Welcome to my Daily Python & DSA Practice Repository.
I update this folder every single day with new code, concepts, and progress.

📘 What This Folder Contains

🐍 Python practice scripts

🧠 DSA problems & solutions

📝 Notes, explanations, and logic breakdowns

🧩 Mini tasks, challenges, and experiments

🔁 Revisions of previous problems

🗂 Organized topic-wise coding practice

🎯 My Coding Goals

Build strong Python fundamentals

Master Data Structures & Algorithms

Maintain a consistent daily coding habit

Increase my GitHub green streak

Improve problem-solving and optimization skills

Develop mini-projects from my learnings

📈 Daily Rules I Follow

✔ Write at least 1 commit every day

✔ Solve 1–3 DSA questions

✔ Learn one new concept

✔ Refactor old code for readability

✔ Push everything before the end of the day

Consistency increases skills more than speed.
Even small but steady progress makes a huge difference.

“One day or day one — you decide.”

“Practice isn't a task. It's a habit.”

🛠️ Keep Coding…

Stay consistent, stay focused

Every commit counts

Small steps → Big progress

Never stop learning
